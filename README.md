## Description

This is a blogging app focused on technology topics that allows users to create, edit and delete blogposts and comments. This full-stack app is built from scratch with the help of nodejs, express, sequelize, express-session, dotenv, connect-session-sequelize, and finally, the handlebars template engine on the front end.

## Deployed Application

This app is deployed to Heroku here: https://confer-the-code.herokuapp.com/

## Future Improvements

 * Adjust the blog comments functionality to allow users to edit or delete comments
 * Show which user commented with their username and the comment's timestamp
 * Updating blog posts isn't available for newly signed up users, just existing users
 * Always room for improvement on the UI!
